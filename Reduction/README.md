# Workflow

This folder uses the **reduction method** to examine and mitigate potential bias in a machine learning model for hiring prediction. The overall workflow is:

1. Perform EDA on the dataset: [EDA](./EDA.ipynb)
2. Train a baseline model and evaluate: [Baseline](./Baseline.ipynb)
3. Apply the fairless method, Reduction, and compare the result: [Reduction](./Reduction.ipynb)
